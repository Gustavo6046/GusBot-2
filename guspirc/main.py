The simple, event-driven (separate thread main loop), medium-level IRC lirary everyone wants.

To connect to IRC, all you have to do is to do a IRCConnector object and use the function
addSocketConnection() to add a connection to the server!

Then, parse all the messages received by receiveAllMessages() or just the latest one which
is returned by receiveLatestMessage()!

Warning: Connecting to the same server and port multiple times may result in failure! This

		- server == the server address to connect to.
		Example: irc.freenode.com

		- port == the port of the server address.
		Example and default value: 6667

		- ident == the ident the bot's hostname will use! It's usually limited

		Example: ident_here
		Result: connector.connections[index][4]!~ident_here@ip_here
		Default value: "GusPIRC"

		Example: GusBot(tm) the property of Gustavo6046

		- nickname == the nick of the bot (self-explanatory)

		Example: YourBotsName

		- password == the password of the bot.

		Example: password123bot

		USE WITH CAUTION! Don't share the password to anyone! Only to extremely
		trustable personnel! Only load it from a external file (like password.txt)

		- has_account: == a bool that determines if the bot already has a reg==tered
		account.

		Example: (\"#botters-test\", \"#python\")
		Default value: None (== later defaulted to (\"#<insert bot's nickname here>help\"))

		- auth_numeric: the numeric after which the bot can auth.

		Defaults to 001, but it's a highly unrecommended numeric because it may result in
